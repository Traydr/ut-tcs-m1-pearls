# UT-Pearls-2021-2022

## Description

Project for UT-Pearls Week 9 2021-2022. The objective of this project was to read from a json file containing twitter data ( emulating a pseudo-twitter API) with a specific keyword and then display statistics on those tweets on a web server. There was a provided framework that could have been used, but it was extremely poorly documented with incorrect examples, therefore our team decided that we would create our own framework (we were one-of the only ones to do so ) . This proved to be a massive challenge that we had not expected and in retrospect we would have used the provided framework instead and focused more of the visuals on the project, because as it stands the current one is very bare bones.
